# graphCreator

There are 2 files .py and .blend 
.py does nothing it is just a pure code 
.blend is a finished project however you will need a program Bledner to open it

This project is a graph creator made for an api that gives you current currency value however it can be easly changed for example to different api 
Basically this code takes values from api and converts them into graphs
